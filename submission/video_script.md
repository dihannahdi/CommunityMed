"CommunityMed AI: Empowering Community Health Workers with MedGemma"

## Duration: 3 minutes

## SCENE 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Visual: Map of Africa and South Asia with TB burden indicators]**

**Narrator:**
"Tuberculosis kills 1.3 million people every year. In resource-limited settings, patients wait 3 to 4 months from first symptoms to treatment. This delay costs lives."

**[Visual: Community Health Worker visiting a village]**

"Community Health Workers are the frontline of healthcare for millions. But they lack the tools to identify TB early, when treatment works best."

---

## SCENE 2: Our Solution (0:30 - 1:15)

**[Visual: CommunityMed AI interface on a tablet]**

**Narrator:**
"Introducing CommunityMed AI – a multi-agent diagnostic assistant powered by Google's MedGemma foundation models."

**[Visual: Architecture diagram animating]**

"Our system uses multiple specialized AI agents working together:
- A Radiology Agent that analyzes chest X-rays
- A Clinical Agent that assesses symptoms
- An Audio Agent that analyzes cough sounds
- And a Triage Agent that prioritizes cases"

**[Visual: Demo of symptom input and results]**

"A Community Health Worker simply enters patient symptoms. Our AI analyzes the case and provides clear, actionable recommendations."

**[Visual: Triage result showing URGENT with recommendations]**

"The result? Accurate triage in seconds, with specific next steps the CHW can follow."

## SCENE 3: Technical Innovation (1:15 - 1:45)

**[Visual: Code snippets and model training metrics]**

**Narrator:**
"Under the hood, CommunityMed AI leverages MedGemma's multimodal capabilities. We fine-tuned the 4B model on TB X-ray datasets using QLoRA, achieving a 15% improvement in detection sensitivity."

**[Visual: Spectrogram of cough audio]**

"For our Novel Task, we developed AI-powered cough analysis. By converting audio to spectrograms, MedGemma can identify acoustic patterns associated with TB."

**[Visual: Model size comparison chart]**

"For edge deployment, we quantized our models to run on mobile devices – just 2.2 GB for offline screening."

---

## SCENE 4: Impact (1:45 - 2:30)

**[Visual: Statistics and impact metrics]**

**Narrator:**
"Our goal: support 10,000 Community Health Workers across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, reaching 6 million patients annually."

**[Visual: Timeline showing diagnostic delay reduction]**

"We aim to cut TB diagnostic delays in half – from 90 days to 45 days – saving countless lives."

**[Visual: CHW using the app in a clinic setting]**

"CommunityMed AI is designed for real-world use:
- Works offline on basic smartphones
- Integrates with existing CHW workflows
- Costs less than 10 cents per screening"

**[Visual: Open source and partnership logos]**

"It's open source, sustainable, and ready for partnerships with global health organizations."

---

## SCENE 5: Closing (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Visual: CommunityMed AI logo and demo URL]**

**Narrator:**
"CommunityMed AI – bringing the power of Google's MedGemma to the people who need it most."

**[Visual: QR code to live demo]**

"Try our live demo. See the code. Join us in the fight against TB."

**[Visual: Team credits and contact info]**

"Thank you for watching. Together, we can make AI healthcare accessible to everyone."

## Alternative Short Version (60 seconds)

**[For social media or quick pitch]**

"TB kills 1.3 million people yearly. Community Health Workers need AI tools to detect it early.

CommunityMed AI uses Google's MedGemma – multiple AI agents analyzing X-rays, symptoms, and even cough sounds to triage patients in seconds.

Fine-tuned for TB. Optimized for mobile. Open source.

Our goal: 10,000 CHWs. 6 million patients. 50% faster diagnosis.

CommunityMed AI – AI healthcare for everyone."
